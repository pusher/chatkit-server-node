## [0.12.2](https://github.com/pusher/chatkit-server-node/compare/0.12.1...0.12.2) - 2018-07-23

### Changes

- Bump jsonwebtoken dependency to 8.3.0

## [0.12.1](https://github.com/pusher/chatkit-server-node/compare/0.12.0...0.12.1) - 2018-04-24

### Changes

- The package name has been changed to `@pusher/chatkit-server`

## [0.12.0](https://github.com/pusher/chatkit-server-node/compare/0.11.2...0.12.0) - 2018-04-23

### Changes

- Bump pusher-platform-node dependency to 0.13.0
- `authenticate` now returns an object like this:

```js
{
    "status": 200,
    "headers": {
        "Some-Header": "some-value"
    },
    "body": {
        "access_token": "an.access.token",
        "token_type": "bearer",
        "expires_in": 86400
    }
}
```

where:

* `status` is the suggested HTTP response status code,
* `headers` are the suggested response headers,
* `body` holds the token payload.

If there's an error with the authentication process then the return value will be the same but with a different `body`. For example:

```js
{
    "status": 422,
    "headers": {
        "Some-Header": "some-value"
    },
    "body": {
        "error": "token_provider/invalid_grant_type",
        "error_description": "The grant_type provided, some-invalid-grant-type, is unsupported"
    }
}
```

- Authentication no longer returns refresh tokens.

If your client devices are running the:

* Swift SDK - (**breaking change**) you must be using version `>= 0.8.0` of [chatkit-swift](https://github.com/pusher/chatkit-swift).
* Android SDK - you won't be affected regardless of which version you are running.
* JS SDK - you won't be affected regardless of which version you are running.

## [0.11.2](https://github.com/pusher/chatkit-server-node/compare/0.11.1...0.11.2) - 2018-04-17

### Additions

- Added `update_user` function and example

## [0.11.1](https://github.com/pusher/chatkit-server-node/compare/0.11.0...0.11.1) - 2018-04-10

### Fixes

- Fix `createUser` to work with `avatarURL` and `customData`

## [0.11.0](https://github.com/pusher/chatkit-server-node/compare/0.10.0...0.11.0) - 2018-04-09

### Changes

- All functions now take a single object as their only argument. Check the [documentation](https://docs.pusher.com/chatkit/reference/server-node) for specifics on how to make calls using the new format.

Some examples:

`authenticate` used to be called like this:

```js
chatkit.authenticate('my-user-id', { grant_type: 'client_credentials' });
```

and the new version is called like this:

```js
chatkit.authenticate({
  userId: 'my-user-id',
  authPayload: { grant_type: 'client_credentials' }
});
```

`createUser` used to be called like this:

```js
chatkit.createRoom('ham', 'New room');
```

and the new version is called like this:

```js
chatkit.createRoom({
  creatorId: 'ham',
  name: 'New room'
})
```

- `authenticate` no longer requires the `grant_type` to be specified. If no value for it is provided then it will take a default value of `client_credentials` (which was already the implicit default provided by clients)

## [0.10.0](https://github.com/pusher/chatkit-server-node/compare/0.9.2...0.10.0) - 2018-03-12

### Changes

- `getRoomMessages` now has a signature of `getRoomMessages(userId: string, roomId: number, options: GetRoomMessagesOptions = {})`

### Fixes

### Additions

### Changes

- When using `createUser` the promise that is returned now resolves with the JSON response from the API (which contains the user information), if the request succeeds

### Removals

- Removed permissions constants and permissions checking from the SDK. The API will return a sensible error if you provide an invalid permission name

## [0.8.3](https://github.com/pusher/chatkit-server-node/compare/0.8.2...0.8.3) - 2018-01-04

### Additions

### Changes

- Don't parse response in apiRequest (since it isn't always JSON)

## [0.7.2](https://github.com/pusher/chatkit-server-node/compare/0.7.1...0.7.2) - 2017-12-11

### Changes

## [0.7.1](https://github.com/pusher/chatkit-server-node/compare/0.7.0...0.7.1) - 2017-11-23

### Fixes

- Correctly type the user id array in `getUsersByIds` as `Array<string>` instead of `Array<number>`

## [0.7.0](https://github.com/pusher/chatkit-server-node/compare/0.6.0...0.7.0) - 2017-11-20

### Changes

- `assignRoomRoleToUser` and `assignGlobalRoleToUser` now work regardless of whether or not a role has previously been assigned for a user

### Removals

- `reassignRoomRoleForUser` and `reassignGlobalRoleForUser` were removed

## [0.6.0](https://github.com/pusher/chatkit-server-node/compare/0.5.2...0.6.0) - 2017-11-16

### Additions

- Adds functionality to update permissions for existing roles by introducing two new functions: `updatePermissionsForRoomRole` and `updatePermissionsForGlobalRole`.

## [0.5.2](https://github.com/pusher/chatkit-server-node/compare/0.5.1...0.5.2) - 2017-11-10

### Fixes

- Make `createRoom` work if `userIds` isn't provided or is an empty array when creating a room.

### Changes

- Make the response in the success case of room creation into an appropriate object from the body's JSON as opposed to an `IncomingMessage` object.

## [0.5.1](https://github.com/pusher/chatkit-server-node/compare/0.5.0...0.5.1) - 2017-11-10

### Changes

- `createRoom` now takes a `CreateRoomOptions` object as its second parameter. This allows creating private rooms and adding users to a room at the point of creation. This looks like:

```js
chatkit.createRoom(
  'user_id_creating_room',
  {
    name: 'my room',
    isPrivate: true,
    userIds: ['some_other_user', 'and_another']
  }
).then(() => {
  ...
}
```
